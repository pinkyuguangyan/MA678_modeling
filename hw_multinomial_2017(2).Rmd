## Multinomial logit: 
Using the individual-level survey data from the 2000 National Election Study (data in folder nes), predict party identification (which is on a 7-point scale) using ideology and demographics with an ordered multinomial logit model.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
nes5200<-read.dta("http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/nes/nes5200_processed_voters_realideo.dta")
#saveRDS(nes5200,"nes5200.rds")
#nes5200<-readRDS("nes5200.rds")
# logistic regression of vote preference on income
nes5200_dt <- data.table(nes5200)
  yr <- 2000
nes5200_dt_s<-nes5200_dt[ year==yr,]
nes5200_dt_s$income <- droplevels(nes5200_dt_s$income)
nes5200_dt_s$partyid7 <- droplevels(nes5200_dt_s$partyid7)

nes5200_dt_s$gender <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$gender, labels=c("male", "female"))
nes5200_dt_s$race <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$race, labels=c("white", "black", "asian", 
                                    "native american", "hispanic"))
nes5200_dt_s$south <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$south)
nes5200_dt_s$ideo <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$ideo, labels=c("liberal", "moderate", "conservative"))

nes_data_comp<-nes5200_dt_s[complete.cases(nes5200_dt_s[,list(partyid7,income,ideo,female,white)])]
nes_data_comp$ideology <- scale(nes_data_comp$ideo_feel,center=TRUE)
```
1. Summarize the parameter estimates numerically and also graphically. 

```{r}
#partyid7,ideology,weight1,age,gender,race,edu1,region
data<-nes_data_comp[,c("partyid7","gender","race")]
data<-na.omit(data)
library(dplyr)
data<-data %>%
  count(partyid7,gender,race)

model<-polr(partyid7~factor(gender) + factor(race) ,weights = n, data = data)
#summary the model
round(summary(model)$coef,2)
#plot
predx<- expand.grid(gender=c("female","male"),race=c("white","black","asian","native american","hispanic"))
predy<-predict(model,newdata=predx,type="p")


ggplot(melt(cbind(predx,predy),id.vars = c("gender","race")))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+aes(x=race,y=value, fill=variable)+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5)) +
  facet_grid(~gender)
pred<-predict(model,type = "p")
#ggplot(melt(cbind(data[,-"partyid7"],pred),id.vars = c("gender","race")))+
  #geom_bar(stat="identity")+aes(x=race,y=value, fill=variable)+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5)) +
  #facet_grid(~gender)
```
*The graph shows that there is no significant difference between female and male. The black has the most number of strong democrat.*
2. Explain the results from the fitted model.

$log(\frac{\pi_2+\pi_3+\pi_4+\pi_5+\pi_6+\pi_7}{\pi_1})=-1.76-0.49*female-1.54*black-0.01*asian-0.06*native_american-0.45*hispanic$
*For a white male, the log odds of he is a weak democrat or independent-democrat or independent-independent or independent-republican or weak republican or strong repiblican is -1.76.*

$log(\frac{\pi_3+\pi_4+\pi_5+\pi_6+\pi_7}{\pi_1+\pi_2})=-1.03-0.49*female-1.54*black-0.01*asian-0.06*native_american-0.45*hispanic$
*For a white male, the log odds of he is an independent-democrat or independent-independent or independent-republican or weak republican or strong repiblican is -1.03.*

$log(\frac{\pi_4+\pi_5+\pi_6+\pi_7}{\pi_1+\pi_2+\pi_3})=-0.38-0.49*female-1.54*black-0.01*asian-0.06*native_american-0.45*hispanic$

$log(\frac{\pi_5+\pi_6+\pi_7}{\pi_1+\pi_2+\pi_3+\pi_4})=-0.07-0.49*female-1.54*black-0.01*asian-0.06*native_american-0.45*hispanic$

$log(\frac{\pi_6+\pi_7}{\pi_1+\pi_2+\pi_3+\pi_4+\pi_5})=0.59-0.49*female-1.54*black-0.01*asian-0.06*native_american-0.45*hispanic$

$log(\frac{\pi_7}{\pi_1+\pi_2+\pi_3+\pi_4+\pi_5+\pi_6})=1.46-0.49*female-1.54*black-0.01*asian-0.06*native_american-0.45*hispanic$



3. Use a binned residual plot to assess the fit of the model.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
newdata<-dcast(data, gender + race ~ partyid7, value.var = "n")
newdata[is.na(newdata)]<-0
newdata<-newdata %>%
  mutate(total=apply(newdata[,3:9],1,sum))
newdata[,3:9]<-round(newdata[,3:9]/newdata[,"total"],2)
pred<-predict(model,newdata=newdata,type="p")
resid<-newdata[,3:9]-pred

for(i in 1:7)
  binnedplot(pred[,i],resid[,i])

```
*Residual plots shows that the there are extreme residuals beyond the CI,so that the model does not fit well.*

# High School and Beyond 
The hsb data was collected as a subset of the High School and Beyond study conducted by the National Education Longitudinal Studies program of the National Center for Education Statistics. The variables are gender; race; socioeconomic status; school type; chosen high school program type; scores on reading, writing, math, science, and social studies. We want to determine which factors are related to the choice of the type of program—academic, vocational, or general—that the students pursue in high school. The response is multinomial with three levels.

```{r}
data(hsb)
?hsb
```

1. Fit a trinomial response model with the other relevant variables as predictors (untransformed).
```{r}
model<-nnet::multinom(prog ~ gender+race+ses+schtyp+read+write+math+science+socst , data=hsb)
summary(model)
```

2. For the student with id 99, compute the predicted probabilities of the three possible choices.

```{r}
student<-hsb[hsb[,"id"]==99,]
predict(model,student,type="p")
```


# Happiness
Data were collected from 39 students in a University of Chicago MBA class and may be found in the dataset `happy`.
```{r}
library(faraway)
data(happy)
?happy

```

1. Build a model for the level of happiness as a function of the other variables.
```{r}
model<-polr(factor(happy)~money+factor(sex)+factor(love)+factor(work),data=happy)
summary(model)
```

2. Interpret the parameters of your chosen model.
$log(\frac{\pi_3+...+\pi_{10}}{\pi_2})=-0.84+0.02*money-1.03*sex_1+3.46*love_2+7.85*love_3-1.19*work_2+0.02*work_3+1.85*work_4+0.65*work_5$

*For people whose family income is 0, and is unsatisfactory with sex and feel lonly, and has no job, log odds of that one with happy index from 3 to 10 over him or her with happy index = 2, is -0.84*

```{r}
kable(cbind(happy[,2:5],round(fitted(model),2)))
```

3. Predict the happiness distribution for subject whose parents earn $30,000 a year,
who is lonely, not sexually active and has no job.
```{r}
money<-as.data.frame(30)
sex<-as.data.frame(0)
love<-as.data.frame(1)
work<-as.data.frame(1)
sample<-cbind(money,sex,love,work)
colnames(sample)<-c("money","sex","love","work")
pred<-predict(model,sample,type="p")
kable(pred)
```

# newspaper survey on Vietnam War
A student newspaper conducted a survey of student opinions about the Vietnam War in May 1967. Responses were classified by sex, year in the program and one of four opinions. The survey was voluntary. The data may be found in the dataset `uncviet`.  Treat the opinion as the response and the sex and year as predictors. Build a proportional odds model, giving an interpretation to the estimates.

```{r}
data(uncviet)
?uncviet
model<-polr(policy~sex+year,weights=y,data=uncviet)
summary(model)

```
$\frac{P(policy\ is B\ or\ C\ or\ D)}{P(policy\ is\ A)}=exp(-1.11-0.65*sex_male+1.18*year_Grad+0.40*year_Junior+0.54*year_Senior+0.13*year_Soph)$

*With same year of school, the odds of a male has opinions B (follow the present policy) or C (withdraw troops to strong points and open negotiations on elections involving the Viet Cong) or D (immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops) is exp(-0.65) times of the same odds of a female.*

*With same gender, the odds of a Graduate has opinions B (follow the present policy) or C (withdraw troops to strong points and open negotiations on elections involving the Viet Cong) or D (immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops) is exp(1.18) times of the same odds of a Freshman.*

*With same gender, the odds of a Junior student has opinions B (follow the present policy) or C (withdraw troops to strong points and open negotiations on elections involving the Viet Cong) or D (immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops) is exp(0.40) times of the same odds of a Freshman.*

*With same gender, the odds of a Senior student has opinions B (follow the present policy) or C (withdraw troops to strong points and open negotiations on elections involving the Viet Cong) or D (immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops) is exp(0.54) times of the same odds of a Freshman.*

*With same gender, the odds of a Soph student has opinions B (follow the present policy) or C (withdraw troops to strong points and open negotiations on elections involving the Viet Cong) or D (immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops) is exp(0.13) times of the same odds of a Freshman.*

$\frac{P(policy\ is C\ or\ D)}{P(policy\ is\ A)}=exp(-0.01-0.65*sex_male+1.18*year_Grad+0.40*year_Junior+0.54*year_Senior+0.13*year_Soph)$

$\frac{P(policy\ is D)}{P(policy\ is\ A\ or\ B\ or\ C)}=exp(2.44-0.65*sex_male+1.18*year_Grad+0.40*year_Junior+0.54*year_Senior+0.13*year_Soph)$

# pneumonoconiosis of coal miners
The pneumo data gives the number of coal miners classified by radiological examination into one of three categories of pneumonoconiosis and by the number of years spent working at the coal face divided into eight categories.

```{r}
library(faraway)
data(pneumo,package="faraway")
?pneumo
```

1. Treating the pneumonoconiosis status as response variable as nominal, build a model for predicting the frequency of the three outcomes in terms of length of service and use it to predict the outcome for a miner with 25 years of service.

```{r}
model_nominal<-multinom(status~year,weights=Freq,data=pneumo)
summary(model_nominal)
miner<-as.data.frame(25)
colnames(miner)<-"year"
predict(model_nominal,newdata=miner,type="p")
```

2. Repeat the analysis with the pneumonoconiosis status being treated as ordinal. 

```{r}
model_ornidal<-polr(status~year,weights=Freq,data=pneumo)
summary(model_ornidal)
predict(model_ornidal,newdata=miner,type="p")
```

3.Now treat the response variable as hierarchical with top level indicating whether
the miner has the disease and the second level indicating, given they have the
disease, whether they have a moderate or severe case. 

```{r}
data_normal<-pneumo[pneumo$status=="normal",]
data_mild<-pneumo[pneumo$status=="mild",]
data_severe<-pneumo[pneumo$status=="severe",]
data_abnormal<-rbind(data_mild,data_severe)
data_abnormal$status<-rep("abnormal",dim(data_abnormal)[1])
data_h1<-rbind(data_normal,data_abnormal)
data_h1$status<-factor(data_h1$status)
model_h1<-multinom(status~year,weights=Freq, data=data_h1)
summary(model_h1)
data_h2<-rbind(data_mild,data_severe)
data_h2$status<-factor(data_h2$status)
model_h2<-multinom(status~year,weights=Freq,data=data_h2)
summary(model_h2)

predict(model_h1,miner,type="p")
predict(model_h2,miner,type="p")
```
*It shows that the predicted probability of this miner is abnormal is 0.17, and the probability of this miner is normal is 0.83. Then we go on for the second model, the probability of his disease is mild is* $(1-0.44)*0.17=0.1$, *and the probability of his disease is severe is.* $0.44*0.17=0.07$ 

4.  Compare the three analyses.

```{r}
#residual plot1
pneumo_new<-dcast(pneumo, year ~ status, value.var = "Freq")
pneumo_new<-pneumo_new %>%
  mutate(total=apply(pneumo_new[,2:4],1,sum))
pneumo_new[,2:4]<-round(pneumo_new[,2:4]/pneumo_new[,"total"],2)
pred1<-predict(model_nominal,newdata=pneumo_new,type="p")
resid1<-pneumo_new[,2:4]-pred1

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
for(i in 1:3)
  binnedplot(pred1[,i],resid1[,i])

#residual plot2
pred2<-predict(model_ornidal,newdata=pneumo_new,type="p")
resid2<-pneumo_new[,2:4]-pred2

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
for(i in 1:3)
  binnedplot(pred2[,i],resid2[,i])
#residual plot3
p_abnormal<-predict(model_h1,pneumo_new,type="p")
p_normal<-1-p_abnormal
p_severe<-p_abnormal*predict(model_h2,pneumo_new,type="p")
p_mild<-p_abnormal*(1-predict(model_h2,pneumo_new,type="p"))
pred3<-cbind(p_mild,p_normal,p_severe)
resid3<-pneumo_new[,2:4]-pred3

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
for(i in 1:3)
  binnedplot(pred3[,i],resid3[,i])

```

*The first and third analysis have similar binned residual plots.*

*And most residuals of 1,3 analysis fall in the CI, but the 2 analysis have some extreme residuals, so that the 1,3 analysis are better.*
